React state in 2025 is noticeably less chaotic than in previous years. Server components, clearer data-fetching conventions, and a handful of compact state libraries address most common needs. The practical approach below reflects these changes.

## The landscape right now

- Server Components (RSC) are common for rendering and reduce the need for client state for initial render.
- Client state still matters for interactivity, caching, optimistic updates, and local UI state.
- A few libraries dominate because they keep things small and straightforward: Zustand, Jotai, React Query (TanStack Query), and Redux Toolkit for very structured apps.

## Recommended patterns

1. Use server components for data-heavy pages where possible.
2. Use a data-fetching cache (TanStack Query) for remote data and mutations — it handles retries, stale-while-revalidate patterns, and cache invalidation effectively.
3. For local client state (UI toggles, form drafts), employ a small store such as Zustand or Jotai.
4. For large, complex state with many cross-cutting reducers, Redux Toolkit remains a practical choice.

## Quick library notes

- TanStack Query: Not a state manager in the classic sense — it’s a remote-data cache. It covers most server-data needs and pairs well with RSC.
- Zustand: Minimal, ergonomic, and integrates well into TypeScript. Zero boilerplate for small app stores.
- Jotai: Atom-based (primitive pieces of state). Great when you want isolated state pieces without prop-drilling.
- Redux Toolkit: Comes into play when you need predictable immutability, middleware, or time-travel debugging. More boilerplate, but very structured.

## Example setup (recommended pattern)

- Server components fetch canonical data and render.
- Client components use TanStack Query for mutations and updates.
- Local UI pieces use Zustand atoms where appropriate.

This provides server-rendered pages with snappy client interactivity while keeping client-side complexity minimal.

## Edge cases and gotchas

- Overusing global stores: Don’t shove everything into a single global object. Split concerns: remote data vs local UI state.
- SSR hydration mismatch: watch for differences between server and client initial states — keep defaults stable and fetch client-only state on mount.
- Persistence: If you need to persist UI drafts, keep the logic small and explicit (localStorage wrapper around the tiny store).

## Final advice

The best state approach in 2025 is pragmatic: rely on the server when possible, use a robust remote-data cache, and use small client stores for local UI. This combination reduces bugs and maintains a smooth developer experience. Teams that require structured state management can continue using Redux Toolkit where it fits.
