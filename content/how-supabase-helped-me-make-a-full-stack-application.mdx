Supabase is a popular backend choice for prototypes and production projects where minimal infra management is desired. Below is a concise account of how Supabase can accelerate shipping a fullstack application and the situations that may require extra decisions.

## What I used from Supabase

- Auth (email, OAuth providers)
- Postgres (managed, with row-level security)
- Realtime subscriptions (for live updates)

## Why I picked Supabase

- Speed: I can get auth and a database up in minutes.
- Familiarity: Postgres under the hood means I don't have to learn a new query language.
- Full feature set: Auth + DB + storage + realtime gives me most server needs without wiring multiple providers.

## The build story (short)

1. Modelled user and post tables using the Supabase SQL editor.
2. Enabled row-level security and implemented a policy allowing authenticated users to insert posts.
3. Integrated front-end auth using the Supabase JS client; the auth flow is straightforward.
4. Employed Realtime to push new posts to subscribed clients for a live feed.

## When Supabase removed friction

- No infra setup for Postgres — saves a week when you’re just trying to prototype.
- Auth and OAuth flows are boringly simple; that’s a good thing.
- Storage + signed URLs made file handling easy without S3 config.

## Pain points and considerations

- Policies & RLS: Row-level security is powerful but easy to misconfigure. Test your policies thoroughly.
- Realtime scale: Works great for low-to-medium traffic apps; for massive realtime workloads you may need to think about architecture and limits.
- Vendor lock-in: Supabase is largely Postgres-compatible, but some managed features (Edge Functions, Storage APIs) will tie you into their platform.
- Local development: Supabase local emulators exist, but syncing state with the cloud can get tricky — keep a staging project for reliable testing.

## Tips & tricks I picked up

- Use typed Postgres clients (generate types from your schema) to avoid runtime errors.
- Keep RLS policies in source control by scripting migrations (SQL files), not only editing in the dashboard.
- Cache read-heavy queries on the client with TanStack Query to reduce DB load.
- Combine Edge Functions for small server tasks (email sending, webhook handling) to keep the client simple.

## Suitability and final thoughts

Supabase frequently hits the sweet spot between speed and capability for many projects. For hyper-scale or highly specialized database workloads, a managed Postgres provider with separate services may be more appropriate, but Supabase can accelerate delivery for the majority of typical applications.
